      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
       <p>
        I am Khari Rivers and I am 15 years old. I was born in Atlanta, Georgia in Piedmont hospital. I lived in cobb county for a little while, but then we moved out to Clayton county to Morrow Lake city in a condo complex. Then two years later, my little sister came along in 2006. In 2008, i attended Walter F. White elementary school from Kindergarten through 3rd grade and unfortunately, the school got closed down. Then i went to another school called Beecher Hills elementary where i finished elementary from 4th to 5th grade. After elementary, i attended Latin Acaademy charter School or LACS, from 6th through 7th grade, where we learned many rigorous things. But my 7th grade year was when the school also closed down because of financial issues. So for my 8th grade year, i was lucky enough to attend Kipp Ways Academy where the work started to get a lot more challenging. Because i went to kipp ways, i was able to get into the Kipp high school. I was able to get into Kipp Atlanta Collegiate. Right now, i have completed the 9th grade, and i am going to the 10th this up coming year. After high school, i plan on attending Morehouse and then tranfering to Georgia Tech for a duel degree. I will Major in either aerospace or Mechanical Engineering.

      <h2>Why Did I Come Here</h2>
       <p>
        I came here because I wanted to come to a place where I won't feel like I'm the odd one out and i can learn more information over the summer. I am greatful to be here because I have made friends and I also have the opportunity to be on a college campus and be a little bit independent. The most important thing is also to be prepared for going to college. I also get to learn computer science. But i mainly came here because i didn't want to be bored over the summer. I'd rather be here than sitting at home playing games and being bored  all day.
